## Goal
To provide new services for smart meters based on data
## Motivation
There are 5 data-mining tasks we can perform
* Predict (consumption, production, tariff prices, etc)
* Classify (the expected client size, etc.)
* Identify (some peaks that should never occur, maybe someone's throwing a party?)
* Recommend (what should be the best tariff for a client?, What should be the most adequate contract power?)
* Evaluate performance (compare) with other clients
## Methodology
Analyse and expand/combine the dataset in order to get more relevant features (day, hour and weekday instead of timestamp)
## Aim
To create a simulator using our predictions to help clients to evaluate they're current status
